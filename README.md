# electron-vue
> The boilerplate for making electron apps using vue (pretty much what it sounds like).

####**This project is still in development. Check the TODO's below for future plans.**

## Overview
The aim of this project is to remove the need to setup electron apps using vue. Since vue can take advantage of module loaders like webpack, getting everything to play nicely can be a little tricky.

**Check out the documentation [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).**

Things you'll find in this boilerplate...
  * Basic project structure
  * Ready to use Vue plugins ([vue-resource](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-resource), [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router), [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex))
  * A working set of the [vue-devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) for development
  * Ability to easily create releases/builds of your electron app using [electron-userland/electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager)
  * Use of webpack and [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) for Hot Module Replacement
  * CSS pre-processor support (SASS/SCSS [more to come])
  * ES6 by default
  * ESLint (extends 'standard')
