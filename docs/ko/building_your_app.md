# Building Your App

electron-vue supports both [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager) and [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) to build and distribute your production ready application. Both build tools are backed by the amazing [@electron-userland](https://github.com/electron-userland) community and each have detailed documentation. During `vue-cli` scaffolding you will be asked which builder you will want to use.

## [`electron-packager`](using-electron-packager.md)

If you are new to making electron applications or just need to create simple executables, then `electron-packager` is perfect for your needs.

## [`electron-builder`](using-electron-builder.md)

If you are looking for full installers, auto-update support, CI building with Travis CI & AppVeyor, or automation of rebuilding native node modules, then `electron-builder` is what you will need.
