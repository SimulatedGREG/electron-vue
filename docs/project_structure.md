# Project Structure
 When it comes to making electron apps, project structure is a little different. The documentation below attempts to explain how the boilerplate works and the differences when the app is built.

## Using two `package.json`'s
 Yes, you read that right. There are **two** `package.json` files. Here's why...
  1. **Bloatware** makes our build's file size way too large for distribution. Do we really want to include all those large `node_modules` along with all their miscellaneous files, and even those  modules that we are only using during development (ex. `vue-loader`, `eslint-loader`)? NO, we need to separate our dependencies.
  2. **Native NPM modules** (those written in C, not pure JavaScript) for our app need to be compiled against electron. [**More info**](http://electron.atom.io/docs/tutorial/using-native-node-modules/). If we used only one `package.json`, how would we know which modules need to be compiled for electron and the others with your local instance of node for development? It might be possible, but separating our dependencies just makes more sense.

#### `./package.json` is for all your development needs
Here you should install modules that you only need during development. Items include scripts, pre-processors, module loaders, etc. In this boilerplate all of the `webpack` dependencies are saved here and **will not** be published in the final production build.

#### `./app/package.json` is for your actual electron app
**This `package.json` is your app's manifest.** Here you should install all your dependencies needed in your final app. It is inside this `app` folder that electron-packager creates production builds.

##### Installing Native NPM modules
As mentioned above, we need to make sure our native npm modules are built against electron. To do that, we can use [electron/electron-rebuild](https://github.com/electron/electron-rebuild).

## File tree
#### During development
```
electron-vue
├─ app
│  ├─ dist
│  ├─ icons
│  ├─ node_modules
│  ├─ src
│  │  ├─ components
│  │  ├─ vuex
│  │  │  └─ modules
│  │  ├─ App.vue
│  │  ├─ main.js
│  │  └─ routes.js
│  ├─ electron.js
│  ├─ index.ejs
│  └─ package.json
├─ builds
├─ node_modules
└─ tasks
|  ├─ vue
|  └─ vuex
└─ config.js
└─ package.json
└─ webpack.config.js
```
#### Production builds
```
app.asar
├─ dist
│  ├─ build.js
│  └─ index.html
├─ electron.js
└─ package.json
```
##### Notice
**`node_modules`** are ignored in production builds

As you can probably tell, almost everything is stripped down in final production builds. This is almost mandatory when distributing electron apps, as you do not want your users to download bloated software with a large file size.

#### On the subject of webpack bundling
All modules within the dependency tree of `app/src/main.js` will be bundled with webpack. In other words, webpack will **only** bundle your renderer process JavaScript. 

> What about bundling my main process?

There is currently no plan to support main process bundling as hot-reloading is not stable enough *yet* for node processes. Without it, developing in the main process would require restarting your electron app every time you want to run new code. In my opinion, find another way to accomplish your task in the renderer process.

> Is there a workaround?

Yes, but it can be cumbersome when building in production. Check [this issue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue/issues/22) for more information.
