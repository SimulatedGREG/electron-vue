### [`axios`](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

> Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js

If you are familiar with `vue-resource`, then `axios` will feel very familiar as most of the API is nearly identical. You can easily import `axios` in your `main` process scripts or use with `this.$http` & `Vue.http` in the `renderer` process.

### [`vue-electron`](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/vue-electron)

> The vue plugin that attaches electron APIs to the Vue object, making them accessible to all components.

A simple `vue` plugin that makes electron APIs easily accessible with`this.$electron`, no longer needing to import `electron` into every component necessary.

### [`vue-router`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router)

> `vue-router` is the official router for [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/). It deeply integrates with Vue.js core to make building Single Page Applications with Vue.js a breeze.

The provided project structure should feel familiar to the setup provided in the official `vuejs-templates/webpack` boilerplate.

### [`vuex`](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex)

> Vuex is a **state management pattern + library **for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.

The provided project structure is rather bare but does encourage the use of `vuex`'s module pattern to help organize your data stores. The extra `@/store/modules/index.js` let's your `vuex` store import all modules in a one-shot manner.
